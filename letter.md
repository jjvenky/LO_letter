# Letter outline

1. Overview of preprints
    1. What is a preprint? 
    2. Major repositories
    3. Are there different kinds? (e.g. biorXiv vs Biogeosciences Discussions)
2. Adoption of preprints in other fields
    1. Physics/astronomy: a million preprints in arXiv
    2. Biology/ecology
        1. ref to biorXiv
        2. NIH: adoption of preprints in proposals - see [this](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-050.html) recent NIH announcement
2. Benefits of preprints
    1. To scientific community
    2. To ASLO (are there any?)
4. Recommendations: 
    1. L&O should actively encourage authors to post preprints prior to L&O submission
    2. Any policy specifics? "No manuscripts with a DOI" seems to be the current policy - what is a better policy?
