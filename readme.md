# Background

Bob Howarth, EiC of L&O, hosted a forum at the 2017 Aquatic Sciences meeting about how to publishb in L&O. He mentioned that there is an advisory board that is preparing recommendations for modernization at L&O, and it also became apparent that:

a. L&O does not have a formal preprint policy
b. He's not very aware of preprints, but he's open to learning more about them
c. His current view (based on Wiley policy, I think) is that when a document is assigned a DOI, it counts as being 'published', so posting a manuscript to a preprint server would count as prior publication and would preclude publicaiton at L&O
d. He's particularly annoyed with the existence of Biogeosciences Discussions. This appears to be his main contact with 'preprints' (although I don't know that BgD really counts as a preprint, in the way I think about them)

# Purpose

The purposes of this letter would be to:

a. Inform Dr. Howarth (& the L&O board & advisory group) about the advantages of preprints
b. Explain the process of preprints - what counts as a preprint, what doesn't
c. Specifically address what to do about Biogeosciences Discussions & similar journals (are there any others quite like it?)

# Format

The letter needs to be short - 500 words at most.

# Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute. Anyone **in the limnology and oceanography community** (broadly defined) is welcome to sign. (To preprint advocates who don't are unlikely to ever publish in L&O: I'd love your comments, but I think this letter is more convincing if it comes from the aquatic science community.)
