# Background

Bob Howarth, EiC of L&O, hosted a forum at the 2017 Aquatic Sciences meeting about how to publishb in L&O. He mentioned that there is an advisory board that is preparing recommendations for modernization at L&O, and it also became apparent that
a. L&O does not have a formal preprint policy
b. He's not very aware of preprints, but he's open to learning more about them
c. His current view (based on Wiley policy, I think) is that when a document is assigned a DOI, it counts as being 'published', so posting a manuscript to a preprint server would count as prior publication and would preclude publicaiton at L&O
d. He's frustrated with the policy of Biogeosciences Discussions, and desk-rejects anything 'published' there

# Purpose

The purposes of this letter would be to 
a. Inform Dr. Howarth (& the L&O board & advisory group) about the advantages of preprints
b. Explain the process of preprints - what counts as a preprint, what doesn't
c. Specifically address what to do about Biogeosciences Discussions & similar journals (are there any others quite like it?)
